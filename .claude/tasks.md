## Instructions

This file will be automatically populated when you initialize the memory system.

**To initialize:**
1. Fill in `projectbrief.md` with your project details
2. Copy relevant stack modules from `claude-memory/stacks/` to `.claude/`
3. Ask Claude: "Read SETUP.md and initialize the memory system"

Claude will create implementation tasks based on your projectbrief.md features and requirements.
